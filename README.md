# breast-cancer-classification
Description

This project predicts whether a breast tumor is benign or malignant using machine learning and neural networks. It leverages the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset, which includes various diagnostic features extracted from breast tumor samples.

Overview

The Breast Cancer Classification system is developed using Python and TensorFlow/Keras. The model is trained to classify tumors by analyzing essential features extracted from medical data. The project includes:

Data preprocessing, including handling missing values and standardization.

Splitting data into training and testing sets.

Training a neural network for tumor classification.

Evaluating model performance using accuracy metrics.

A predictive system that classifies tumors based on user-provided data.

Features
